For this, it is essential to have good theoretical knowledge of Tajweed rules as well as the skills to practically apply them. In addition to this, young Muslims should be well-grounded in their beliefs, able to apply the laws of Allah and His Messenger ﷺ to their everyday lives and draw examples from the esteemed Sahabah (companions) and salaf salihoon (pious predecessors), as well as our rich Islamic history.

## Timing
3 days a week from 5-7pm.
