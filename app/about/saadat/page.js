          Sayyids, Sadaat or Ashraaf are the honorary titles for those who
          belong to the bloodline of the Holy Prophet ﷺ (May Allah’s peace and
          blessing be upon him). <br/><br/>The Muslims from the time of the Prophet ﷺ have
          shown great reverence to those related to Allah’s Messenger ﷺ in any
          way. This was mainly in recognition of the honour bestowed upon him by
          the Almighty Allah (SWT). As the Almighty said in the Qur’an,<br/>‘Say (to
          them), if you love Allah then follow me’. <br/><br/>The four rightly guided
          Caliphs of Islam (Abu-Bakr (RA), Umar (RA), Usman (RA) and Ali (RA)) showed great
          reverence for the family of the Prophet ﷺ. For the companions of the
          Prophet ﷺ, the family of the Prophet ﷺ were the most important family
          on earth. The martyrdom of many of them at the hands of a ruthless
          regime in the year 61AH/ 680CE resulted in a widespread revolt across
          the Muslim world, including the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah,
          which ultimately resulted in the regime being toppled and dethroned.<br/><br/>
          The four Imams of Fiqh (Imam Abu Hanifah r.a., Imam Malik r.a., Imam
          Al-Shafiee r.a. and Imam Ahmad r.a.) all showed equal amounts of zeal,
          reverence and respect for the household of the Prophet ﷺ. The Imams of
          Hadith would show immense respect to all the sites linked to the
          Prophet ﷺ, let alone the members of this blessed family. <br/><br/>One special
          ruling for the Muslims is that their Zakah cannot be given to the poor
          from amongst the sayyid families. As a result, the Muslim elders and
          the pious recommend that the needy from amongst the sayyids are taken
          care of out with the Zakah or charity money. They should be given
          gifts and supported by the Muslims. <br/><br/>Imam Muslim r.a. has reported an
          incident in which Ibn Hayyan said, <br/>“I went along with Husain b. Sabra
          and ‘Umar b. Muslim to Zaid b. Arqam, may Allah be pleased with him.
          (Zaid b. Arqam d was a companion of the Prophet ﷺ) As we sat by his
          side, Husain said to him: <br/>“Zaid, you have been able to acquire a great
          virtue in that you saw Allah’s Messenger ﷺ , listened to his speech,
          fought by his side in (different) battles, offered prayer behind him.
          Zaid, you have in fact earned a great virtue. Zaid, narrate to us what
          you heard from Allah’s Messenger ﷺ. ” <br/>Upon hearing this Zaid said,<br/>
          “I have grown old and have almost spent my age and I have forgotten
          some of the things which I remembered in connection with Allah’s
          Messenger ﷺ, so accept whatever I narrate to you, and whatever I do
          not narrate, do not compel me to do that.” He then said, <br/>“One day
          Allah’s Messenger ﷺ stood up to deliver a sermon at a watering place
          known as Khumm situated between Makkah and Madinah. He praised Allah,
          extolled Him and delivered the sermon and exhorted us saying: <br/>‘O
          people, I am a human being. I am about to receive a messenger (the
          angel of death) from my Lord and I, in response to Allah’s call,
          (would bid good-bye to you), but I am leaving among you two weighty
          things: the one being the Book of Allah in which there is right
          guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah and adhere to
          it’. He exhorted us to hold fast to the Book of Allah and then said:<br/>
          ‘The second are the members of my household, I remind you (of your
          duties) to the members of my family’. At this point Husain enquired,<br/>
          ‘Who are the members of his household? Aren’t his wives the members of
          his family?’ (The implication here is that the wives of the Prophet ﷺ
          are referred to as his household in the Qur’an. Check surah al-Ahzab
          verse 33) Thereupon Zaid said, <br/>‘His wives are the members of his
          family (but here) the members of his family are those for whom
          acceptance of Zakah is forbidden’. Husain asked, <br/>‘Who are they?’
          Thereupon Zaid replied: <br/>‘Ali and the offspring of ‘Ali, ‘Aqil and the
          offspring of ‘Aqil and the offspring of Ja’far and the offspring of
          ‘Abbas. Husain asked: <br/>‘So these are those for whom the acceptance of
          Zakah is forbidden?’ Zaid replied, <br/>‘Yes’”. This Hadith is reported by
          Imam Muslim. <br/><br/>It clearly states that looking after the family of the
          Prophet ﷺ was an instruction of the Prophet ﷺ and was viewed as a duty
          by his companions. In his old age, Zaid complains about having
          forgotten many instructions of the Prophet ﷺ, he yet remembered the
          details of the Prophet ﷺ reminder in regard to his family. He passed
          away in the year 68AH, which was seven years after the martyrdom of
          Sayyiduna Husain (RA). His honesty was confirmed by the Qur’an at two
          separate occasions during the life of the Prophet ﷺ and this was
          acknowledged by the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. As mentioned earlier, the
          companions of the Prophet peace be upon him and the learned scholars
          of this ummah, like the four leading Imams of Fiqh, always had serving
          the family of the Prophet peace be upon him as one of their main
          duties in life.
